# odin-recipes
<p>Project recipes on the odine training course. I will be learning how to build a web page while making git commits along the way. The idea is to showcase my learning with html, css, and java, while presenting notes that clearly highlight each step.</p>
<p>I have created an index file, filled out the usual boilerplate html, added h1 heading and created a link to the recipes page.</p>
